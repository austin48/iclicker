# FAQs
reg.remote.faq1.question=Where do I find my remote ID?
reg.remote.faq1.answer=Your i>clicker remote ID is printed on a sticker located on the back of your remote. The ID is the 8-character code below the barcode. Newer original i>clicker remotes have a secondary ID location behind the battery compartment and i>clicker 2 remotes display the ID upon power up. The remote ID will only contain letters A-F and numbers 0-9.

reg.remote.faq2.question=What do I do if I cannot read the ID printed on my remote?
reg.remote.faq2.answer=If your remote ID has rubbed off or is illegible and you do not have a secondary ID location on your remote, go to support.iclicker.com/ for troubleshooting instructions.
reg.remote.faq3.question=Why do I get an "Invalid Remote ID" error when I try to register?
reg.remote.faq3.answer=Your remote ID is an 8-character code that should only contain letters A-F and numbers 0-9. Make sure you are not entering the letter "O" for the number "0" or the letter "I" for the number "1."
reg.remote.faq4.question=I\'ve lost/broken my remote. Can I register another remote?
reg.remote.faq4.answer=Yes, you may register multiple remotes for any reason. i>clicker will link both remotes to your name so that you receive credit for votes you made with either remote.
# GO FAQS
reg.remote.faq5.question=If I register remote in my LMS, does that automatically mean I can use it in all my classes?
reg.remote.faq5.answer=No, registering remote does not automatically mean you will be able to use it in your classes. Your instructor must allow i>clicker and register his or her course to communicate with i>clicker servers. Also, some campuses or classrooms may not have the infrastructure to support i>clicker use. Check with your instructor to be sure that i>clicker is allowed and supported for your course.
# General FAQS
reg.remote.faq6.question=I registered my remote, why is my registration still not appearing in class?
reg.remote.faq6.answer=Your instructor needs to synchronize his or her gradebook to get the latest registration information. It may be that your instructor has not done this since you registered. Your in-class votes were recorded by i>clicker and, once you register your remote, these votes will be associated with you the next time your instructor syncs the course gradebook or roster.
reg.remote.faq7.question=I use my remote for multiple classes. Do I need to register my information for each class?
reg.remote.faq7.answer=No, you only need to register in one location. Once registered, your information will automatically apply to all of the classes in which you are enrolled and using i>clicker.
reg.remote.faq8.question=What do I do if I accidentally registered the wrong remote?
reg.remote.faq8.answer=If you register a wrong remote ID, simply remove the incorrect entry and register again with the correct information.
reg.remote.faq9.question=I've already used my remote in class before registering it in my LMS. Will I still receive credit for my votes?
reg.remote.faq9.answer=Yes, your votes still count. Your in-class votes were recorded by i>clicker and, once you register your remote, these votes will be associated with you the next time your instructor syncs the course gradebook or roster.

#reg.registered.instructions=You have successfully registered your i>clicker remote ID with the system. \
#If you lose or need to tie a second clicker to your student/user ID, you can do so here by adding \
#another clicker ID to your registration. As with your other registration, to locate your clicker ID, \
#see the back of your remote and enter the series of numbers (and perhaps letters) \
#on the white sticker on the bottom of your clicker.
